# Milestones Academy website
A fully responsive website that I designed and developed for a local daycare center, focusing on enhancing user engagement through a clean, modern design and user-friendly navigation. It provides parents with an easy-to-use platform to learn about the daycare's services and available programs. Key features include an interactive map to help parents find the location, an accordion-style FAQ section for quick answers, and a contact form that streamlines the enrollment process.
